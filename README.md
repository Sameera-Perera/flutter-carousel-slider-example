# flutter_carousel_example

In this tutorial, I will show everything you need to know about designing a carousel slider and how to get data from a server(REST API) and show. also, I will save those REST API data into local storage(get storage). so when your relog into the app no need to wait for server data.
In this example code, I used Getx library, and the project created using Flutter version 2.xx. Hope you learn something! don't forget to give like and follow. Thank you!
